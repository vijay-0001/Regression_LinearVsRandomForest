# âš¡ Predicting Power Output from Environmental Variables: A Machine Learning Approach

This project builds and evaluates regression models to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (PE) of a Combined Cycle Power Plant. The plant operates using gas and steam turbines with heat recovery, and the predictions are based on environmental sensor data.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict electrical power output (PE) using ambient environmental variables.
- **Data:** 9,568 hourly readings from a Combined Cycle Power Plant.
- **Source:**  
  PÄ±nar TÃ¼fekci, *Prediction of full load electrical power output of a base load operated combined cycle power plant using machine learning methods*, IJEPES, 2014.

## ðŸ”§ Features Used

The dataset includes the following features:

- `Temperature (T)` in Â°C  
- `Ambient Pressure (AP)` in millibar  
- `Relative Humidity (RH)` in %  
- `Exhaust Vacuum (V)` in cm Hg  
- `PE (target)` â€” Net hourly electrical energy output in MW

## ðŸ§  Modeling Approach

- **Type of Task:** Supervised regression
- **Algorithms Used:**
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- **Validation Strategy:** 5-Fold Cross-Validation
- **Evaluation Metric:** Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), RÂ² Score

We compared models using average RMSE and RÂ² across folds and selected the best-performing model based on validation results.

## ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation

- **Best Model:** Random Forest Regressor
- **Test RMSE:** _<your value>_  
- **Test RÂ² Score:** _<your value>_

The final model was retrained on the full training set and evaluated on a hold-out test set. A scatter plot of predicted vs. actual PE values demonstrates the model's accuracy.
